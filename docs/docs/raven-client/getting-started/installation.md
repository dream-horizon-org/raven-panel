### Development Environment

- Node.js >= 18.0
- npm, yarn, or pnpm package manager
- React Native CLI or Expo CLI

### Optional Dependencies

These are not required but may be useful:

- `react-native-safe-area-context` - For safe area handling
- `lottie-react-native` - For Lottie animations in nudges

## Install the Package

### Using npm

```bash
npm install @dreamhorizonorg/raven-client
```

### Using yarn

```bash
yarn add @dreamhorizonorg/raven-client
```

### Using pnpm

```bash
pnpm add @dreamhorizonorg/raven-client
```

## Install Peer Dependencies

The SDK requires several peer dependencies. Install them if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install @react-navigation/native react-native-gesture-handler @gorhom/bottom-sheet
```

### iOS Setup

For iOS, you'll need to install pods:

```bash
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

### Android Setup

No additional Android setup is required beyond the standard React Native setup.

## Expo Configuration

If you're using Expo, add the plugin to your `app.json`:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": ["@dreamhorizonorg/raven-client/app.plugin"]
  }
}
```

## Verify Installation

After installation, you can verify the SDK is properly installed by importing it:

```typescript
import { ravenClient } from "@dreamhorizonorg/raven-client";

console.log("Raven Client installed successfully!");
```

## Next Steps

Now that you've installed the SDK, proceed to the [Quick Start Guide](/docs/raven-client/getting-started/quick-start) to initialize and use it in your app.
